# Unit2.FreelancerForum-Yohnka
In this workshop, you will create a platform where independent freelancers can advertise their services. 

This workshop utilizes javascript to update the content of a list of freelancers.  This mimics freelancers making their services available.  This code is written with a call interval that adds names from a given object at 1 second intervals until all objects have been listed.  The average cost of available freelancers is captured in the footer of the html.
